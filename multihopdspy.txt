          "Red (Taylor Swift album) | Red is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 22, 2012, by Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her third studio album, \"Speak Now\". The album title was inspired by the \"semi-toxic relationships\" that Swift experienced during the process of conceiving this album, which Swift described the emotions she felt as \"red emotions\" due to their intense and tumultuous nature. \"Red\" touches on Swift's signature themes of love and heartbreak, however, from a more mature perspective while exploring other themes such as fame and the pressure of being in the limelight. The album features collaborations with producers and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol and Ed Sheeran and is noted for Swift's experimentation with new musical genres. Swift completed The Red Tour in support of the album on June 12, 2014, which became the highest-grossing tour of all time by a country artist, grossing over $150 million.",
